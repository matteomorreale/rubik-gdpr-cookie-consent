/* 
    The backbone was made with Manus AI, but don't worry. It didn't even compile.
    Than I've used Claude to fix it, but still: it didn't work.
    Finally I've used ChatGPT to fix other things, but still: didn't work.
    At least I've used my brain to fix the rest.
    Now it works, but I don't know how.
    I hope you will enjoy it.
    If you find any bug, please report it to me.
    I can give it a look and maybe fix it, or maybe not an I'll just say that it's a feature.
